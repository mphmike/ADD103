      Something that makes this album so striking is the way Lexa Gates blends
      genres with such taste and subtlety, creating a cohesive, seamless sound.
      The foundation rests in hip-hop and rap, with tracks like Dirt and What
      You Wish For driving the record's rhythmic energy. Yet, she shifts
      effortlessly into other styles—songs like Alone and Thinking of You lean
      into the softness of '90s neo-soul and R&B, layering ethereal synths and
      interesting vocal layers that give the music its fresh but nostalgic glow.
      These vocal layers in particular stand out, adding warmth and texture that
      feels both intimate and timeless. Jazz influences also surface throughout
      the album, from warm piano chords to dusty horns and organic drum
      patterns, all of which enhance its homegrown, soulful character. A
      brilliant album rooted in tradition but alive with originality.
